## Overview

**Project Title**: 

Steam Games Data Analyzer

**Project Description**: 

A python program using the pandas and matplotlib libraries to analyze a .csv file of Steam games and user playtime/purchases. The program answers two questions I had about the dataset.

**Project Goals**:

Learn how to use pandas to analyze data and another library to graph it.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Run "pip install python3".
2. Run "pip install pandas".
3. Run "pip install matplotlib".

Instructions for using the software:

1. Run the software.
2. Input either a 1 or a 2 to view the data that answers the respective question.
3. Wait for the graphs to display.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Python
* Pandas
* Mathplotlib

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/visualization.html)
* [mathplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/pandas_intro.asp)
* [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tamber/steam-video-games)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Make the graphs appear on a user input
* [ ] Combine with the results of another steam dataset
* [ ] Enhance readability
